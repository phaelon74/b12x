"""Offline MX-FP6 (W6A6) weight quantization + save/load for *dense* linears.

This is the dense counterpart of
:mod:`sparkinfer.quantization.mxfp6.fp6_moe_weights`. It targets ordinary
``nn.Linear`` weights (MLP gate/up/down, attention q/k/v/o projections) and the
block-scaled :func:`sparkinfer._lib.dense_gemm.dense_gemm` kernel, rather than
fused-MoE experts.

W6A6 split (same as MoE):

* **Weights** are static, so they are quantized once here into the packed
  MX-FP6 codes + swizzled UE8M0 block-scales that ``dense_gemm`` consumes.
* **Activations** are data-dependent, so :func:`dense_fp6_linear` quantizes them
  to FP6 on the fly each forward (via the GPU quantizer), then runs the matmul
  fully in 6-bit.

A linear ``y = x @ W.T`` with ``W`` shape ``(out_features, in_features)`` maps
directly onto ``dense_gemm``: the activation ``x`` ``(M, K)`` is the LHS and the
weight ``W`` ``(N, K)`` is the RHS (``dense_gemm`` computes ``a @ b.T``), so the
HF weight layout is used as-is with no transpose.

Scaling mirrors the validated ``test_dense_gemm_mxfp6_*`` recipe: each operand
uses a bf16 global-scale that maps its amax into FP6 range, and
``alpha = 1 / (a_gscale * b_gscale)`` undoes both at the epilogue.
