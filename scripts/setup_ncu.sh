# Nsight Compute readiness check for FP6 kernel profiling (plan item E0).
#
# Non-destructive by default: it detects, verifies, and prints exact
# remediation. Pass --apply to write the modprobe drop-in that grants non-root
# GPU counter access (still requires sudo, and still requires a reboot).
#
# Why non-root access matters: profiling under `sudo` loses the venv, the
# CUDA/torch environment, and the SPARKINFER_* configuration that selects the
# kernel we are trying to measure, so a sudo-only setup tends to profile the
# wrong build. `benchmarks/analyze_ncu_source.py` documents the sudo form; this
# script exists so we can drop the sudo.
#
# Usage:
#   ./scripts/setup_ncu.sh            # detect + verify
#   ./scripts/setup_ncu.sh --apply    # also install the modprobe drop-in
